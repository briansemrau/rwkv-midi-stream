# rwkv-midi-stream

Currently a bit messy. Set up to run with my local configuration across WSL2 and Windows.

## Getting set up on windows

For using CUDA:
- download ninja, add to your path
- copy python39.lib to venv/Scripts/libs/python39.lib

To connect MIDI ports:
- download loopMIDI and run
